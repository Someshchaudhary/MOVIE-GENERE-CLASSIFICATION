# Genre Classification Dataset

This repository contains a dataset and related materials for a genre classification project. The dataset includes training and test data for building and evaluating classification models.

## File Descriptions

### 1. `description.txt`
- **Content**: Provides an overview of the dataset and its structure. The text briefly introduces the data's purpose, focusing on classifying music genres based on specific features.

### 2. `train_data.txt`
- **Content**: Contains the training dataset.
- **Format**: 
  - Each row represents a song, with tab-separated fields.
  - The first field is the genre label, followed by numerical features that describe the song.
  - Example:
    ```
    rock	0.34	0.89	0.23	0.56	...
    classical	0.12	0.78	0.34	0.98	...
    ```

### 3. `test_data.txt`
- **Content**: Contains test data without genre labels.
- **Format**:
  - Each row corresponds to a song, represented by its numerical features (tab-separated).
  - Example:
    ```
    0.41	0.85	0.33	0.72	...
    0.15	0.65	0.48	0.91	...
    ```

### 4. `test_data_solution.txt`
- **Content**: Provides the true labels for the test data.
- **Format**:
  - Each row contains a single genre label corresponding to the rows in `test_data.txt`.
  - Example:
    ```
    rock
    jazz
    ```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Training the Model**:
   - Use `train_data.txt` to train your machine learning model.
   - Ensure to parse the tab-separated format correctly, with the first column as the target variable (genre) and the remaining columns as features.

2. **Testing the Model**:
   - Predict the genres for the songs in `test_data.txt` using your trained model.
   - Compare the predictions against `test_data_solution.txt` to evaluate model accuracy.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Normalize or standardize the feature values if required.
   - Handle missing data or outliers based on the model's requirements.

## Example Workflow
1. Load `train_data.txt` and preprocess the data.
2. Train a genre classification model using the training dataset.
3. Load `test_data.txt` and make predictions.
4. Use `test_data_solution.txt` for evaluation.

## Notes
- Ensure the data is split into appropriate training and validation sets if additional evaluation is required.
- Features are numerical and may represent audio or other derived characteristics of songs.
